# Contributing to CFOKit

Thanks for your interest. Bug reports, documentation fixes and code are all welcome.

This file covers the **process** of contributing, and deliberately holds no project rules.
Those live in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and the [decision records](docs/decisions/README.md);
restating them here would give them a second home to drift from, which is the failure
`CLAUDE.md` names when it says a second rules document becomes a second source of truth.

## Before you start

Read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md). It is the project's constitution, and every rule in it cites
the decision record holding its reasoning. If a task appears to require breaking a rule, ask
rather than working around it.

## Reporting a bug

Open an issue. Include what you did, what you expected, what happened instead, and the
versions of CFOKit, Python and Postgres you were running.

**Do not open a public issue for a security vulnerability.** Contact the maintainers
privately.

## Suggesting a change

Open an issue before writing code for anything larger than a fix, so the approach can be
agreed before you spend time on it.

A decision that future work should be bound by belongs in a decision record rather than a
code comment. [`docs/decisions/README.md`](docs/decisions/README.md) explains the format and
[`adr-template.md`](docs/decisions/adr-template.md) is the starting point.

## Setting up

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) only — not pip, not poetry.

```bash
uv sync              # install everything
uv run task --list   # every command, and what it does
```

`docker compose up` brings up the full stack locally. It needs no cloud account.

## Running the checks

```bash
uv run task lint
uv run task test
```

CI runs these and more on every pull request.
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) is the authority on what has to pass.

## Opening a pull request

- Work on a branch. Never commit to `main`.
- One logical change per commit, with an imperative subject line.
- Cite the requirement or `ADR-` id when a change implements or follows one. Requirement ids
  are defined in [`requirements.md`](docs/product/requirements.md).
- Say which checks you ran locally, and flag anything you could not verify. A red suite
  belongs in the pull request description, not in the reviewer's discovery.
- If part of the work is incomplete or blocked, say so. Scaling work down is a maintainer's
  call rather than something to do quietly.

## Review

A maintainer will review. Expect as many questions about reasoning as about code — this is an
accounting system, and *why is this correct?* is the substance of the review.

## Licensing

CFOKit is [Apache 2.0](LICENSE). Contributions are accepted under the same licence, which
Apache 2.0 § 5 makes the default. There is no separate CLA to sign.
